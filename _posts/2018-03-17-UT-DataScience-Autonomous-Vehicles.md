On 14 March, 2018 we had one of the awesome data science events organized by the institute of computer science. This time topic was about autonomous vehicles, a hot and growing fields which benefits AI mechanisms more and more. The most interesting of all were the Andrej Karpathy's talk from Tesla.

This is my quick notes and overview on the talks:
- [ISEAUTO](http://iseauto.ttu.ee/en/mainpage/) (TTÃœ ja SILBERAUTO AS): self-driving car project of the Estonia - it looked like more as an autonomous minibus, AI-powered using ROS and ROS modules, mostly performed by students as their bachelor/master/phd thesis! 
- [Starship](http://tarship.xyz) presented by Lindsay Roberts - an interested project for package delivery using autonomous robots. The talk focused on localization of the robots mainly by employing intertial sensors and landmarks captures using edges in the image. Bottleneck of the system (huge amount of the features detected and used to this date). The main algorithm under the hood for this is a particle filter!
- Milrem Robotics: Modular Military Vehicles (structure), Autonomous exploration and navigation in Estonia's forests.
- A presentation on legal matters and need for adapting new regulations to the new technologies.

I put Andrej Kaparthy's talk in an agenda format:
- Tesla autnomous cars are the largest group of robots employed in the world
- Tesla, toward a sustainable, autonomous, and safe transporation
- Tesla cars are giant animals of tiny brain mapping sensory inputs to the steering and acceleration
- A progression towards software 2.0 from 1990 -- 2010
- [software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35) a concept that Andrej has written on recently
- From hard-automation to data-automation
- Massaging the data instead of massaging the code (yet another software 2.0 implication)
- Conundrums towards solving the autonomous car problem: rising philosophical questions 
- Not just classes rare, but the scenarios rare (very odd incidents, few examples to learn from)
- Idea of autonomous vehicle started in 1989 Pomerleau Alvinn; an autonomous land vehicle
- Many machine vision practice obsolete now like sift, however SLAM, visual odometry, and many other would be around for now
- How debug software 2.0: massaging the data! interpretable stack
- Autnomous vehicles future progress: development of the infrastructure (i.e. induction lanes), smarter cars
- My car is always charged, plugged on both ends
- graduated from numpy, using [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org)
