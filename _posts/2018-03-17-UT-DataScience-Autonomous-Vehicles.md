On 14 March, 2018 we had one of the awesome data science events organized by the institute of computer science. This time topic was about autonomous vehicles, a hot and growing fields which benefits AI mechanisms more and more. The most interesting of all were the Andrej Karpathy's talk from Tesla.

This is my quick notes and overview on the talks:
- [ISEAUTO](http://iseauto.ttu.ee/en/mainpage/) (TTÃœ ja SILBERAUTO AS): self-driving car project of the Estonia - it looked like more as an autonomous minibus, AI-powered using ROS and ROS modules, mostly performed by students as their bachelor/master/phd thesis! 
- [Starship](http://tarship.xyz) presented by Lindsay Roberts - an interested project for package delivery using autonomous robots. The talk focused on localization of the robots mainly by employing intertial sensors and landmarks captures using edges in the image. Bottleneck of the system (huge amount of the features detected and used to this date). The main algorithm under the hood for this is a particle filter!
- Milrem Robotics: Modular Military Vehicles (structure), Autonomous exploration and navigation in Estonia's forests.
- A presentation on legal matters and need for adapting new regulations to the new technologies.

I put Andrej Kaparthy's talk in an agenda format:
- Tesla autnomous cars are the largest group of robots employed in the world
- Tesla, toward a sustainable, autonomous, and safe transporation
- Tesla cars are giant animals of tiny brain mapping inpu
